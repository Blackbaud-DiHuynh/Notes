Problem: the portion of the xref page times out because of high admin jvm usage

Solution: 
  - query the number of active campaigns, n (from CRM)
  - if n < our threshold -> display page as is
    else only query the first n active campaigns (either alphabetical order or time)
  - load those campaigns to memory, store where the query locator left off
  - add prev/next button and warning to the screen
  - if the customer click prev/next, load the correct set of campaigns
  - need to remove everything BUT the set of campaign in the UI


Things to consider:
  - what is our threshold? 
    Salesforce query limit is: 100 (synch), 200 (async)
    needs QA to test with various number of campaigns
  - How to use query locator?
  - Does RE need this?

  - ways to break up this big story: 
      back end (how to use query locator, CRM-LO data transfers, how to handle different sets of campaigns)
      front end (pagination, how to talk to back end)


QueryResults
  QueryLocator queryLocator
  Boolean done
  sObject[] records
  int size

Query Locator
  - example without a specific number of records
      https://www.salesforce.com/developer/docs/api/Content/sforce_api_calls_query.htm#topic-title
  - queryLocator value exprires after 15 mins of inactivity
  - can use standard Apex or Batch Apex(higher limit)
  - can be used in a loop, queryMore() is called implicitlyac
    List<Account> accounts = new List<Account>();
    for ( List<Account> accountBatch : [SELECT Id, Name FROM Account] )
        accounts.addAll( accountBatch );
  - only 10 query cursors at a time, the oldest will be released when the 11th one is used. INVALID_QUERY_LOCATOR
    will be thrown if a released/expired cursor is called

  - Doc:
      String getQuery()
      Database.QueryLocatorIterator iterator()  - hasNext() and next()


LO code path 
  pageTag = campaign_edit_xrefs
  CampaignHandler.processRequest



  XRefType.getFieldInfoList()     - get a list of stuff to xref, like Campaigns and Designation
  GenericFieldChoices.getChoicesFiltered  - choiceMap is the list of Campaigns to choose from, should probably look for where this is populated
  m_foreignType of field(IXRefFieldInfo) is Select c.Id, c.Name from Campaign c where c.IsActive = true
  

  Check:
    where m_foreignType is passed in
    where fieldChoices is populated (XRefFKChoices)


Oh inheritance and LO
  XrefType implements IXRefFieldInfo
  FieldInfo implements IXRefFieldInfo
