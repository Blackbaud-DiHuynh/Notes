- Quick intro
  + mobile application for Major Gift Officers who travels often to meet clients
  + related to, but a separate product from LCRM
  + we implemented a prototype of this mobile app at Off The Grid so some of you might have
    seen this already

- Salesforce1 platform
  + basically provides the mobile-friendly version of all of the standard pages/layouts/objects of the web application
  + what we have to do, is to make sure all of our custom stuff are mobile friendly as well
  + add functionality that makes sense for mobile instead of a desktop application
    -> finding donors in the nearby area
    -> seeing donors as they enter an events

- This sprint, I 
  + worked with our UX designer to have a household contact layout that makes sense, with all the important information on top
  + check to see if our dup check works on mobile as is. Short answer, it doesn't.
