SDP: DON_MINIMUM_MANUAL_DONATION

Current implementation: 
 - this doesn't apply to Event Gifts, entered on the admin side in LO
 - in LCRM, when entering a CC donation, there is an error message "Minimum donation: 5.00"
 and the donation wouldn't process
 - Sign in as a constituent, give a gift to another TR participant - limit seems to be $5.00 no matter what
 - Sign in as a constituent, go to that constituent's TR, enter gift - the limit applies here if the gift is CC

in LCRM, admin enters 
- cash gift
- CC gift from TR reg
- ACH gift
- CC gift in Batch

in LO, cons enters
- CC gift 
- Cash gift


Expected behaviors:
- any donations entered in LCRM should not subject to this SDP
- additional gifts should respect this SDP
- if a user manually enters donations, only CC transactions should respect this SDP

Test cases: 
- make sure Bug 45566 still works, ie additional gifts below SDP should NOT work
- all kinds of TR gifts from LCRM works: Cash, Check, CC offline, ACH Offline
