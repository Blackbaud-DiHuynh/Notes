Apigee API design


Nouns, not verbs

associations, keep them simple
	- /resource/identifier/resource

versioning
partial response
	- allow devs to pick what fields to get back
	- /dogs?fields=name,size
	- no need to do work to fill in unneeded fields (might take a while to calculate)
pagination
	- allow devs to page the db
	- limit and offset
	- include metadata

exception handling

provide an SDK
	- if you don't, your customers will create one and they might do it wrong
	- reduce bad or inefficient code
	-
