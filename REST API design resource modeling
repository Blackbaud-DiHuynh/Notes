REST API design resource modeling

Fine-grained vs coarse-grained
	fine-grained: more chatty api, more requests to get the thing you want
		/blogPost
		/tag with postId
		/picture
	coarse-grained: not as chatty, more complicated
		/post with tag, picture in body

Prevent migration of business logic to API consumer
