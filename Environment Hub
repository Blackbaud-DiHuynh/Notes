Best practices:
  - use Partner Business org as the master org (or hub org)
    - https://partners.salesforce.com/s/education/general/Partner_Business_Org
    - give all users access
```
You should never enable Environment Hub in the DE org that contains your managed package â€” this could cause issues when you try to upload a new package version or pushing an upgrade to your customers.
```
    -> so no packaging org

- enable SSO for all users
  - use roles and profiles to set up permissions
  

Questions for QA:
  - How are we currently creating new org?
