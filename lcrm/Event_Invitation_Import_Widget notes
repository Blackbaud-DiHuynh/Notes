Overwrite 'Add Multiple Invitation Button' with VF instead of scontrol (Event_Invitation_Import_Wizard.scf)


TODOs: 
- write queries to get
  + Report folder  
      Select Id, name, type, accessType from Folder where Type='Report' and Name like '%' 
  + Report 
      Select Id, name, ownerId FROM Report Where OwnerId= <FOLDERID> 
  + invitation record type: 
      Schema.DescribeSObjectResult a = Event_Invitation__c.sObjectType.getDescribe(); 
      List<Schema.RecordTypeInfo> recInfos = a.getRecordTypeInfos();
      System.debug(recInfos);
      // Schema.RecordTypeInfo[getName=Master; getRecordTypeId=012000000000000AAA; isAvailable=true; isDefaultRecordTypeMapping=false;])
  + registration stage: 
      Schema.sObjectType objType = Event_Invitation__c.getSObjectType();

      // Describe the SObject using its object type.
      Schema.DescribeSObjectResult objDescribe = objType.getDescribe();       

      // Get a map of fields for the SObject
      Map<String, Schema.SObjectField> fieldMap = objDescribe.fields.getMap(); 

      // Get the list of picklist values for this field.
      List<Schema.PicklistEntry> values = fieldMap.get('Stage__c').getDescribe().getPickListValues();

What kind of button
  Detail Page Button    appear on any page of that object
  Detail Page Link      a link (duh)
  List button           appear on "list" of invitations

  So we want list button
 
How does this work

- user selects Report Folder, Report, invitation record type, registration stage -> "import and create"
- popup: 3 new invitations will be created (0 already had invitations). Are you sure?
- Results: 
    3 Record(s) found in the report.
    3 Valid records.
    0 Records that already have invitations for this event.
    3 New invitations created for this event.

- calls requestReport()
  * get id of rpt (report?)
  * get reg stage, reg record type ID
  * get a xmlhttp object for the report
  -> calls processReqChange2
    * check to see if the reports have ContactID and AccountID 
       * if yes keep index, no throw an error
       * disable the "working" indicator
    * parse the contact and account ids to create registration
      * for each line in the report, parse the line to get contactID and accountID
      * check to see if any of the contacts/accounts already registered
        * split the contact ids into arrays of size 500 
        * query: SELECT Id, Contact__c 
                  FROM Event_Invitation__c 
                  WHERE Contact__c in ("stringOfIds") 
                        AND Event__c = 'Event_Detail__c.Id'
        * add the returned records to "allExistingInvites"
    * remove the existing registrations from the contactIDs
    * now we create a new invitation for this Array
      * inv = new Event_Invitation__c(){ 
      *   Contact__c = contactID,
      *   Account__c = accountID,
      *   Event__c = Event_Detail__c,
      *   Stage__c = SELECTED_REG_STAGE,
      *   RecordTypeId = SELECTED_RECORD_TYPE_ID
      * }
    * if at our batch size limit (200?), insert the invitations

    
    
TESTING PLAN
1. creating lots of invitation
2. recognizing duplicates
3. basic summary report with Contact/Acc ID as groupings
4. basic summary report with Contact/Acc ID NOT as groupings
5. Matrix with Contact/Acc ID as groupings
6. Matrix with ContactID/Acc NOT as groupings
