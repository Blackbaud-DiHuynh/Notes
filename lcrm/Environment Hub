Best practices:
  - use Partner Business org as the master org (or hub org)
    - https://partners.salesforce.com/s/education/general/Partner_Business_Org
    - give all users access
```
You should never enable Environment Hub in the DE org that contains your managed package â€” this could cause issues when you try to upload a new package version or pushing an upgrade to your customers.
```
    -> so no packaging org as the master org

- enable SSO for all users
  - use roles and profiles to set up permissions

Questions for QA:
  - How are we currently creating new org? 


Conclusions: (Di's opinions)
- Environment Hub's main purpose is to provide all users with access to certain number of organizations in the same place. 
  This provides little benefits to our dev orgs since each developer should keep track of his/her own orgs. There is no
  need for a central place for ALL dev orgs. Creating a new org would be about the same amount of work. 

- On the QA side, LENARD/Alfred has been our Environment Hub. I don't know how our site creation/setup work, so I can't 
  say how much
