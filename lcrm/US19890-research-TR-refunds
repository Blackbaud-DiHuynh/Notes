Scenario: 
- Create TeamRaiser Gift, the donation type will be "TeamRaiser Gift"
- Refund that gift
- LCRM will 
  mark it refunded
  change type to "Donation"
  remove link to registration

Desired behavior:
  keep donation type as "TeamRaiser Gift"



Our integration
  only syncs donations tied to a Teamraiser back to LO


LO sends a message to LCRM after the customer hit "Refund" (full amount)

Code flow: 

	LO: 		
		Sweeper task runs, calls getAndDirtyRecords from all the message senders
		RegistrationUniversalFieldMapper.objectToMessage()
			-> RegistrationUniversalFieldMapper.addTransactionFields()
				-> DonationUniversalFieldMapper.setDonationTypeFields()
					-> DonationUniversalFieldMapper.getUniversalDonationTypeField()
						* in here, we set the default type to SINGLE donation
						* then do logic to reset to TeamRaiser Gift or Personal Fundraising
						* but the payment.getDonationType() is REFUND at this point
						* thus we set the Donation Type as Single

	LCRM: 
		UniversalOpportunity.opportunityFromTrRegMessage creates the Opportunity from the TR reg message from LO
			at this point, the message contains <Field name="DonationType">Single</Field>
		
		UniversalOpportunity.addFieldsFromMessage adds the transaction type as expressed in the message
			opp.Transaction_Type__c = TRANSACTION_TYPE_MAP.get(getDataString(msgFields, DONATION_TYPE));


		Thus the transaction type of a refunded LCRM 



Temporary fix: 
	Add to the end of addFieldsFromMessage

	if (getDataBoolean(msgFields, 'Refunded')){
		opp.Transaction_Type__c = TRANSACTION_TYPE_MAP.get(DONATION_TYPE_TR_REG);
	}

	problem: stageName remains Received.... why??
	Who set it to Refunded? 
	all of the refunded tr regs got set their stage to refunded....
