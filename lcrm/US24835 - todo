Questions:
	- Can we create DSP in LCRM and expect it to sync?
	- Do donations towards DSP registration have the TR Registration field filled or Pledge or both?
		- does the donation record type say Pledge Installment


DSP teamRaiser registration with fee
	- donationMessageSender
		-> isSendableDonationType()
			* returns false for DSP since we want it to be a part of the registration message rather than donation
	- registrationMessageSender
		-> objectToMessage()
			-> addTransactionFields()
				* add DSP fields to the message



DSP Registration (Pat $20 fee, goal $100) 
	-> recurring_pledge message
		- create Pledge
			- # of installments - 2
			- Pledge Installment - Pat $20 installment
			- Total: $100
		
	-> Tr reg message
		- create Tr Reg
			- Pledge__c : Pat $100 Pledge
		
		- update Pat's Pledge
			- Tr Reg : Pat registration
			
		- create donation
			- Pledge__c: Pat $100 Pledge
			- Donation Type: Pledge Installment
			- Amount: $20
			- Tr Reg: Pat's registration

Donation towards Pat's (Aaron $20) 
	-> donation message
		- does not updates Pat's Pledge
		
		- creates Donation
			- Aaron $20 donation
			- Tr Reg__c : Pat's registration
			-> this will add the donation to Pat's registration donation related list

Process Pat's DSP registration 
	-> recurring_pledge message comes over to change status from Delayed to Active

	-> when the Recurring Pledge processor processes the pledge another pledge will come over the bus
		- this will mark the pledge Completed with an installment of (goal - fee)
