Deployment
  
Backend services:
  1. Checkout conan-the-deployer from github
  2. Run `gw deployService` with artifactId and version parameters
    - conan will download its dependencies, one of which is cloud-foundry-tools
    - conan deploys with cloud-foundry-tools Deployer class
      a. initialize a descriptor based on the type of the backend service (basic-service, basic-service-broker, basic-static-files)
      b. combine the project-specific configs with the basic-*.yml
      c. cf login to the right env
      d. cf push --no-start to push the new (green) version of the artifact without starting while the old (blue) version is still running
      e. bind new app to app.pivotal-*.blackbaudcloud.com, now blue and green are mapped to main url
      f. unbind the blue app, then delete it
