Producer send: 
	- serialization error -> no retries -> external retries
		- configure retry number, if failed -> log, move on
	- error with kafka (already serialized, sent to kafka proper): some are retry-able, some are not
		- use kafka retries (default is 0)
		- in producer API
		- backoff number

		send(message, callback) returns with failure/success
			- callback has error message

Acknowledgement (acks default is 1)
