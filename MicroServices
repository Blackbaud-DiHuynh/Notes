Chapter 1: Microservices

What are Microservices? 
  - small, autonomous services that work together
  - â€œGather together those things that change for the same reason, and separate those things that change for different reasons."
  - can be deployed in isolation
  - able to be changed independently of each other
  - services expose APIs for others to consume

Key Benefits
  - able to embrace different technologies, choose the right tool for each job
  - if something fails, the rest can carry on. Unlike in a monolithic application where everything has to stop
  - in monolithic application, scaling = scaling everything as one piece
  - in smaller services, scaling = scale only those that need scaling, better distribution of hardware
  - deployment time
  - easy to spread out teams
  - reusability of services
  - optimized for replacibility, faster to rewrite/sunset

Service oriented architecture
  - SOA = design approach where multiple services collaborate to provide some end set of capabilities
  - microservices : soa :: scrum : agile development

Other decompositional techniques
  - Shared libraries: 
    - lose techonology heterogenetity, libraries need to be in the same language
    - cannot desploy a new library without redeploying the entire process
  
  - modules
    - Open Source Gateway Initiative framework to allow plugins to be installed on Eclipse, now used as a way to retrofit a module concept in Java via a library

Chapter 3: How to Model Services
  
Good services
  - loose coupling
    - knows as little as possible about the services being consumed
    - limit the number of calls from one service to another
  - high cohesion

Bounded context
  - Shared and hidden models
    - only knows what you should know
  - Modules and services
  - premature decomposition
    - code reuse very early on -> lots of changes later across services

Business Capabilities
  - keep this in mind when breaking up modules/services

Turtles all the way down
  - nested boundaries might not be necessary, can lead to complication for testing

The Technical Boundary
  - use technology as a way to split services isn't always wrong
  - consider performance

Chapter 4: Integration

Looking for the Ideal Integration Technology
  - avoid changes that causes consumers to change
  - keep APIs technology-agnostic - technology changes all the time
  - make service simple for consumers
  - hide internal implementation details - decrease coupling, consumers should not be bounded to the internal implementation details

Shared database
  - difficult to change schemas
  - large regression testing
  - only 1 type of database
  - logic to deal with the database (editing Constituent info in the Constituent db) has be to replicated across services - no cohesion
 
Sync vs async
  - sync - predictable, slow
  - async - unpredictable, complex, fast
  - event-based collaboration, publisher publishes "hey this action is done", the subscribers do something with that data

Orchestration vs choreography
  - orchestration = one centralized code to do several things, ie a conductor telling musicians what to play
    - single point of failure
    - can become brittle
    - difficult to change
    - a small monolith
  - choreography = several things subscribed to the same event, when the event happens, the "things" know what to do, ie
    like dancers waiting for a a queue then go off by themselves
    - loosely coupled
    - more flexible
