ERROR
Transient error: Missing Teamraiser Participation Type

REASON
LCRM does not have the Participation Type in the XML message

FIX
Manually create it in LCRM: 
TeamRaiser_Participation_Type__c type = new TeamRaiser_Participation_Type__c();
type.Convio_Participation_Type_ID__c = 1003;
type.Campaign__c = '701o0000000bP7s';
insert type;
