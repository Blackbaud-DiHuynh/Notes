About: 
  based on Mockjito
 
Dependency Injection
  allows programs to be loosely coupled
  3 forms: setter-, interface-, and constructor-based

  Advantages: 
    can be used in legacy code for refactoring
    easier to unit test
    allows a client to remove all concrete implementation that it needs to use
    can be used to externalize a system's configuration details into configuration allowing the system to be reconfigured wi/o recompilation
    reduction of boilerplate code
    concurrent/independent development
    decreases coupling
  
  Disadvantages:
    makes code hard to read since it separates behavior from construction
    diminishes encapsulation by requiring users of a system to know how it work and not merely what task or job it performs. 

Focuses for us:
  reduce DML operations in unit tests

ApexMocks features:
  verify method was called with the correct arguments
  verify a method was called n number of times
  verify a method was never called
  stub a method call with a particular set of arguments to return a particular value
  stub a method call with a particular set of arguments to throw a particular exception

apex-mock-generator
  generates mock implementation automatically

Questions to answer: 
  How should we approach incorporating ApexMocks into your existing unit tests? 
    - new unit tests should use ApexMocks
    - how to convert the old ones? 
      - by code coverage? 
      - by runtime?
      - difficult since some of our code are not unit testable
  
  How are we going to organize mock classes? 
  Code convention
    - given, when, then: good practice for Spock tests in LO, cucumber, and unit testing in general
    - mocks.startStubbing(); mocks.stopStubbing()
    - Test.startTest(), Test.stopTest()
    - method names
  this interface business
  Trigger tests should still have DML operations
  

Tips: 
  refactor all SOQL queries to their own method, makes it easier to stub
  use CampaignTestUtils.getDefaultCampaign()
  use fflib_IDGenerator.generate(Contact.SObjectType)

STEPS TO STUBBING OUT SOMETHING
  - Let's assume you're trying to mock out ReversalUtils.
  - check Mocks.cls to see if the class you're mocking already exists
  - Create an Apex interface for the class you want to mock out.
    - name it I<class name>, ie IReversalUtils
  - Make sure there isn't a space between your method name and the parentheses for parameters
    - in other words: 
        YES: void setEngagementChannelOnGift(Opportunity[] newOpportunity);
        NO:  void setEngagementChannelOnGift (Opportunity[] newOpportunity);
  - the apex-mocks-generator has a couple parsing bugs so make sure your parameters have the spaces in the right places
    - in other words:
        YES: void foo (Map<Id, Opportunity> opps);
        NO:  void foo (Map<Id, Opportunity>opps);

  - Edit interfaces.properties with your new interface
    - IReversalUtils=ReversalUtils

  - Run the following command:
    - java -jar apex-mocks-generator-3.1.2.jar ./src/classes/ interfaces.properties Mocks ./src/classes/
    - this will create a mocked version of your class in the file src/classes/Mocks.cls

  - Save to server to check for syntax errors. 
    - If you find syntax errors, fix the spacing in your interface file (IReversalUtils), and run the command again.
    - DO NOT MODIFY Mocks.cls directly!
    - We want to keep the interfaces.properties file a central place for all of the mocks so Mocks.cls stays consistent
