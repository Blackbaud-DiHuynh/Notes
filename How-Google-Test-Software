Chapter 1: intro
  Quality != test
    - quality is in development stage
    - developers should test incrementally
  Roles 
    - Software engineer: write features
    - Software engineer in Test: refactor code to be more testable, write tests, more concerned with quality
    - Test engineer: write automation, try to break stuff, analyze risks
  Structure
    - small number of test engineers rotating around projects
  Process
    - canary channel: builds that fails often
    - dev channel: daily builds, what devs pull from
    - test channel: montly build for tests, pass most sustained testing
    - beta/release channel: stable test channel builds
  Types of tests
    scope over form, automated or manual
    - small: automated, unit tests, functional issues, data corruption
    - medium: automated, test interacting features, nearest neighbor functions
    - large: real user scenarios, real user data sources, can take hours, in production environment

Chapter 2: Life of Software Engineer in Test
  Development and workflow
    testing should be owned by engineering team
    reuse is rewarded more than complexity or cleverness
