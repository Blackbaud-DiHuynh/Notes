Bug70400-ContactDeactivation

TODO: 
	- check with RELO
	- MemberUpdateTask -> Groups -> Site Admins -> Select Action
		-> check to see if this deactivateCons()
	- 


LCRM side
	Delete user LCRM
		- goes into the recycle bin
		- FIX: null out Convio_Id and all External Revision Ids

	Undelete user in LCRM
		- FIX: null out Convio_Id and all External Revision ids

	Active flag in LCRM
		- when a user uncheck the box, the cons in LO is deactivated
		- when a user re-check the box, the cons in LO is still deactivated
			-> QPM error: "Constituent inactive, cannot make changes"
		FIX: 
		- if unchecked -> same as delete -> null out Convio_Id and all External Revision ids
		- if checked -> same as undelete -> null out Convio_Id and all External Revision ids

	Merge 2 contacts in LCRM
		-> the dupe is deleted in LCRM, goes to the recycle bin
		-> the dupe's cons record in LO is deactivated

LO
	0 = UNAPPROVED (registered but needs approval)
	1 = ACTIVE
	2 = REMOVED
	3 = DENIED
	4 = RESPONSE_AWAITED (opt-in pending)
	5 = PROSPECT

	Merge 2 contacts in LO - Does not work

	Deactivate constituent in LO
		- should this remove the contact in LCRM? Yes but right now it doesn't

	Re-activate constituent in LO
		- how to do this on the UI? 

	Fix: 
		- change ConsMgr.deactivateCons() to clear out member_id, individual_rel_link
			- user action, "remove constituent" from UI
			- won't affect direct database operations like mass delete
			- can add logic to avoid changing RELO
		- remove the cons_sync row in the trigger

	
Integration
	Changes from LCRM 
		1: A contact has the active flag unchecked
		- LCRM: null out Convio_Id and all External Revision ids
		- the service bus sends a message to LO, updates the cons in LO to DEACTIVATED
		- LO: remove the cons_sync record for that SF id ********************************** Check to see if the upsertConsHandler calls deactivateCons
			- has to remove member_id, individual_rel_link from the constituent record
		- Make changes to the contact in LCRM (changes to fields != active__c)
		- Contact syncs over as a new Constituent

		2: A contact has the active flag checked
		- LCRM: null out Convio_Id and all External Revision ids
		- the service sends a message to

		3: A contact is deleted and stay alive in the recycle bin

		4: A contact is undeleted


	Changes from LO
		1: Remove a constituent through the UI
		- LO: remove member_id and individual_rel_link
		- LO: remove cons_sync record
		- NOTHING WILL BE SENT ACROSS THE BUS
		- Changes to the contact in LCRM
		- QPM errors

		2: Reactivate a constituent 
		- LO: remove member_id and individual_rel_link
		- LO: null out salesforce_crm_id and external ids in the cons_sync record
		- the service bus sends a message to LCRM
		- Updates the contact in LCRM with the same cons_id since we never remove that contact in LCRM

		3: Reactivate a constituent and remove in LCRM - DON'T DO THIS
		- LO: remove member_id and individual_rel_link
		- LO: null out salesforce_crm_id and external ids in the cons_sync record
		- the service bus sends a message to LCRM
		- LCRM: manually delete the contact in LCRM
			-> makes a callout to LO to deactivate it
		- Creates a new contact in LCRM
