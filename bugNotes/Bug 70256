Bug 70256-RGsIntegration


Repro: 
- Create a RG
- Seed gift and donation flows to LCRM successfully
- Refund the gift in LO
- Message from LCRM throws transient error: "MissingSuccessfulTransactionId"
- Status in LCRM is NOT updated

Problem:
- refunded transactions move from valued_transaction to refund_transaction
- in RecurringPledgeSyncStatusDao.getProcessorIdsLastSuccessfulPaymentInfo(), we only look in valued_transaction

Fix: 
- Join refund_transaction in the query and see what happens
	- new query 
		SELECT
			vt2.reference_number,
			vt2.transaction_id,
			vt2.value_transacted,
			vt2.orig_value_transacted,
			ts.opportunity_id
		FROM
			(SELECT vt.reference_number, MAX(vt.payment_number) AS max_payment_number
			 FROM dhuynh1.VALUED_TRANSACTION vt
			 WHERE vt.reference_number IN ('T1001')
			 AND site_id = 1
			 GROUP BY vt.reference_number) max_payment
		INNER JOIN
			dhuynh1.valued_transaction vt2 ON
			   vt2.reference_number = max_payment.reference_number AND
			   vt2.payment_number = max_payment.max_payment_number
		INNER JOIN
			dhuynh1.transaction_sync ts ON vt2.transaction_id = ts.transaction_id
		
		UNION

		SELECT rt.reference_number, rt.transaction_id, rt.value_transacted, rt.orig_value_transacted, ts.opportunity_id
		FROM refund_transaction rt
		INNER JOIN
			dhuynh1.transaction_sync ts ON rt.transaction_id = ts.transaction_id
			 WHERE rt.reference_number IN ('T1001')


	- for refunded transactions, the opportunity_id is null -> when the message gets to LCRM (BusRecurringPledgeProcessor.buildSkeletonTransactions())
		creates a stub donation (assuming that the donation hasn't come over the bus yet)
