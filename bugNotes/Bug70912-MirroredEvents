Bug 70912
Questions to answer: 
	Does RELO use mirrored events? 
		Yes, it works for them. We can't enable mirrored fields because they specifically want the fields disabled.

	Does CGE use mirrored events?
		Yes. It works the same way as LCRM.

	How can we make mirrored events fields editable in LO? 
		Change process_cg_mirrored_fields_row.tpt from
		   get_observable_component('[[A0]]').disable(true, false);
		to
		   get_observable_component('[[A0]]').disable(false, false);

		In BeanCGMirroredFieldsComponent.java
			renderViewMode()
				* check for mirrored fields from CG or RE and call process_cg..._row.tpt

	Why are we able to make callouts with a valid convio id but not with a null convio id? 
		Event_Detail_EditController.shouldCallApi() returns true if we have a convio id and false otherwise.	

	What is the impact of a null convio id for an event?
		Can't talk to LO. No bueno. 

	What is the right fix for this issue? 
		Change LCRM to not break with the convio_id
		Add a button in LO "Refresh details from LCRM"
