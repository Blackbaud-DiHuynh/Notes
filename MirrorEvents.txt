Creating Mirror Events

On LCRM
1. Create a new Gala event (goft event won't work)
2. Enter a start date that's in the future
3. Link to a primary campaign



On LO
1. Setup -> Site Option
2. Make sure EVENT_COMMON_GROUND_MIRRORING_ENABLED = TRUE
3. Content -> Events
4. There should be a "Mirror a Luminate CRM Event" button
5. If you did everything correctly, you should be able to see the LCRM event you created earlier


Other notes:
- mirroring takes care of xrefs
- LO will create a calendar event for the mirrored LCRM event by looking at the price set when creating the Event Level in LCRM:
  + if the price is $0, LO will create a RSVP event
  + otherwise, it'll be a ticketed event

- data from a mirrored events can only be changed in LCRM, then sync over

Relevant code: 
LO - OrgEventCreateFromCommonGroundHandler.java
